# not-git
This is no git

# What is this then
pit

# What it does?
Uploads files to server using SCP. It is easy to use, and even a 15yo could do this in nano.

# What is it for?
Well, you can use a Directory Lister and use it as repository page (just Like GitHub) and using this, you can actually push to that server. Easy.

# TO DO:
While I was writing this README file, an ideea started.
What if I make a github clone. An easy to use one?
Like, just download the PHP files, upload them to server
and boom, you got your minimal git :thinking:

So, the first in the TODO list would be a `clone` functionality.
```sh
pit clone user@s.e.r.v.er:/path/to/repo
```

# Note
This Github Clone will not support branches, pull and stuff like that. Not even commit messages. Or maybe? We'll see.
